# Performance Testing with JMeter

## Installation

Follow the download instructions found [here](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi). You'll be asked to download a zip file and unzip the contents into your application directory. In MAC/OSX this is typically the `Applications` directory. In Windows, it's `Program Files`.

Be advised that the latest verision of JMeter needs have Java 8 installed on the host machine.

Once installed, you'll find the executable in the `./bin` directory. The executable file for MAX/OSX is `jmeter`. For Windows, it's `jmeter.bat`.
