# Working with Postman to Exercise a Microservice

The purpose of this lab is to provide an experience in which a student get a microservice up and running at a remote location and then exercises that microservice using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). (You'll need to have Postman installed on your local machine.)

In this lab the microservice we're going to install and invoke is [`pinger`](https://github.com/reselbob/pinger).

**Step 1:** Install `pinger` on Katacoda running as a Docker container. Follow the instructions found [here](https://github.com/reselbob/pinger#building-and-running-pinger-as-a-docker-container-on-katacoda).

Part of the instructions described above will shows you how to expose  `pinger` as a public URL on Katacoda. The illustration below shows a URL generated by a previous implmentation of `pinger` on Katacoda.

![public pinger url](https://github.com/reselbob/pinger/blob/master/images/pinger-04.png?raw=true)

Your installation will have URL or its own. Save your particular URL to `pinger`. You're going to need it when you work with Postman.
